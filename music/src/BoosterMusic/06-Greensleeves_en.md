**Green Sleeves** introduces the key of **G major** which has **one Sharp - F#**. Normally the sharp symbol is not shown when **F#** is played (but turning on **Courtesy Accidentals** from the QPiano setup/preferences menu will show all accidentals in the key signature). The melody is in the right hand with a simple left hand part.

**Hint:** _You can show **Courtesy Accidentals** from the QPiano setup/preferences menu. But remember to **turn them off** when you get more skilled._
