Description: Learn the piano just by playing a game
 A MIDI file player/game that displays the musical notes AND teaches you how
 to play the piano.
 .
 QPiano is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment and
 at the same time learning the basics of reading musical notation.
 The difference between playing along to a CD or a standard MIDI file
 is that QPiano listens and reacts to what you are playing on a
 MIDI keyboard.
 .
 To run QPiano you need a MIDI Piano Keyboard and a MIDI interface
 for the PC. If you don't have a MIDI keyboard you can still try out
 QPiano, using the PC keyboard ('x' is middle C), but a MIDI piano
 is really recommended.
